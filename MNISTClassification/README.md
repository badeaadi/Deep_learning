## MNIST Classification / MNIST Count


### Dataset Description

- First dataset, usual MNIST, 28 x 28 digit
- Second dataset, MNIST COUNT - each image 100x100 contains 1 to 5 digits similar to a normal 28x28 digit


### Assignment : 

- Train a convolutional neural network to classify a 28x28 image.
- Implement a sliding window method on 100x100 images using the previously trained model to detect the number of digits from this bigger images.
- Implement a new convolutional neural network to detect the number of digits.
- Use transfer learning to train the last model.
