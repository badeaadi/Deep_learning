## EEG Classification

In this task, we address a subdataset made from CHB-MIT Scalp EEG Database. 
Our dataset contains every seizure part of the former dataset, and a smaller percentage of the non seizure dataset

### Dataset description :

This database, collected at the Children’s Hospital Boston, consists of EEG recordings from pediatric subjects with intractable seizures. 
Subjects were monitored for up to several days following withdrawal of anti-seizure medication in order to characterize their seizures and assess their candidacy for surgical intervention.
